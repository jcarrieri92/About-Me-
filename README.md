# About Me 
𝗦𝘂𝗺𝗺𝗮𝗿𝘆:
I’m an educator passionate about preparing students for life beyond the classroom. I have six years of experience working in elementary-level education. In those six years, I've spearheaded over 30 school-wide assemblies, served as a Teacher Leader for the second-grade team across four elementary buildings, and consistently fostered a safe environment for my students through an emphasis on social-emotional learning and diversity. My passion for education was highlighted when I was honored to receive NewsChannel 34's Golden Apple Award, recognizing excellence in teaching within the area.

In August of 2023, I assumed a new role at Binghamton University within The Fleishman Center for Career and Professional Development as the Senior Student Engagement Specialist. In this role, my focus is extensively student-oriented, involving one-on-one career consulting, program development, and overseeing a team of 20+ undergraduate and graduate students at Fleishman. My background in K-12 education has equipped me to bring valuable insights into higher education, enabling me to craft impactful and meaningful experiences for students in this new setting. I look forward to meeting with Binghamton students in career consultation appointments and more!
